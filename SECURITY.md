# Security Documentation for Azayd Project

## Overview

This document outlines the security measures implemented in the Azayd project to protect against common web vulnerabilities and ensure data protection. It serves as a guide for developers working on the project and provides information about the security features in place.

## Security Features Implemented

### Backend Security

#### HTTP Security Headers

The application implements the following security headers through the `SecurityHeadersMiddleware`:

- **Content-Security-Policy (CSP)**: Restricts the sources from which content can be loaded
- **X-Content-Type-Options**: Prevents MIME type sniffing
- **X-Frame-Options**: Prevents clickjacking by disallowing the site to be embedded in frames
- **X-XSS-Protection**: Provides additional protection against Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks
- **Referrer-Policy**: Controls how much referrer information is included with requests
- **Permissions-Policy**: Restricts which browser features can be used
- **Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS)**: Forces browsers to use HTTPS for the site

#### Secure File Uploads

The `SecureFileStorage` class enhances file upload security by:

- Validating file MIME types against a whitelist
- Enforcing maximum file size limits (5MB)
- Sanitizing filenames to prevent path traversal attacks
- Using `python-magic` for accurate MIME type detection

#### Rate Limiting

- **Global Rate Limiting**: Limits API requests to prevent abuse (100/day for anonymous users, 1000/day for authenticated users)
- **Contact Form Rate Limiting**: Restricts contact form submissions to 5 per hour

#### Authentication and Authorization

- Default permission class set to `IsAuthenticated` for all API endpoints
- Strong password validation rules

#### Cookie and Session Security

- Secure cookies (HTTPS only)
- HTTP-only cookies to prevent JavaScript access
- Session expiration settings
- CSRF protection

### Frontend Security

#### Input Validation and Sanitization

The frontend implements:

- Input validation for all user inputs
- XSS protection through DOMPurify
- Email and alphanumeric validation
- File type and size validation

#### CSRF Protection

- CSRF tokens included in all AJAX requests
- Meta tag with CSRF token for JavaScript access

#### Content Security Policy

- Nonce-based CSP implementation for scripts and styles
- CSP applied to all inline scripts and styles

## Security Best Practices for Developers

### General Guidelines

1. **Never disable security features** in production environments
2. **Always validate user input** on both client and server sides
3. **Use parameterized queries** for database operations to prevent SQL injection
4. **Keep dependencies updated** to address known vulnerabilities
5. **Follow the principle of least privilege** when implementing new features

### File Upload Guidelines

1. Always use the `SecureFileStorage` class for file uploads
2. Never allow executable file uploads
3. Process uploaded images with Pillow to strip metadata
4. Store uploaded files outside the web root if possible

### Authentication Guidelines

1. Implement proper authentication for all sensitive operations
2. Use Django's built-in authentication system
3. Enforce strong password policies
4. Implement account lockout after failed login attempts

## Security Testing

Regularly perform the following security tests:

1. **Vulnerability scanning** with tools like OWASP ZAP
2. **Penetration testing** to identify potential security weaknesses
3. **Code reviews** focused on security aspects
4. **Dependency scanning** to identify vulnerable dependencies

## Reporting Security Issues

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it by [appropriate contact method].
