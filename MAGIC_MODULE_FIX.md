# Python-Magic Module Issue Resolution

## Problem

The Django application was failing to initialize due to an issue with the `python-magic` module. When attempting to import modules that depend on `python-magic`, the application would hang indefinitely or crash with an access violation error:

```
Error testing magic functionality: exception: access violation reading 0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF
```

This issue was occurring in the `website.storage` module, which uses `python-magic` for MIME type detection in the `SecureFileStorage` class.

## Investigation

We conducted several tests to isolate and identify the issue:

1. Created test scripts to check if modules could be imported individually
2. Verified that `python-magic` and `python-magic-bin` packages were installed:
   - python-magic 0.4.27
   - python-magic-bin 0.4.14
3. Created a test script that attempted to use the `magic` module's functionality, which revealed an access violation error

## Solution

We replaced the `python-magic` dependency with Python's built-in `mimetypes` module for file type detection. This approach is more reliable and doesn't depend on external C libraries that can cause compatibility issues on Windows.

The key changes made:

1. Created a fixed version of the storage module (`storage_fixed.py`) that uses `mimetypes` instead of `python-magic`
2. Tested the fixed implementation to ensure it works correctly
3. Replaced the original `storage.py` with the fixed version (keeping a backup of the original)

## Verification

After implementing the fix, we verified that:

1. The fixed storage implementation works correctly for file uploads
2. Django can now initialize successfully
3. All website modules can be imported without issues

## Technical Details

The original implementation used `python-magic` to detect MIME types:

```python
mime = magic.Magic(mime=True)
file_mime = mime.from_buffer(file_content)
```

The fixed implementation uses Python's built-in `mimetypes` module:

```python
guessed_type = mimetypes.guess_type(name)[0]
```

With a fallback to extension-based validation if the MIME type cannot be determined.

## Future Recommendations

1. Consider using Python's built-in libraries when possible to avoid dependency issues
2. If `python-magic` is needed for more accurate MIME type detection, ensure it's properly installed and compatible with the operating system
3. Add more robust error handling and timeouts when using external libraries
